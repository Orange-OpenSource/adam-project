_{This template just aims at showing an example of README file for your project._

_Please remove all lines within braces like this section._

_Feel free to remove optional sections and add sections according to your project type._

_Nevertheless, **always** keep the_ intro_, the _"Quick start" _and the _"License" _sections}_

SoftwareName as Headline
======

You may insert badges, such as [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Orange-OpenSource/sandBox.svg)](), or [![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/Orange-OpenSource/sandBox.svg?style=social&label=Fork)]() [![star this repo](http://githubbadges.com/star.svg?user=Orange-OpenSource&repo=sandBox&style=flat)](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/sandBox) or any CI status [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Orange-OpenSource/sandBox.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Orange-OpenSource/sandBox.js)

__SoftwareName__ is a software for something. Short and clear description here. You may as well provide a short list
* of the greatest,...
* main and most useful...
* features that the product provides

You should add a [link to the full documentation]()

_{Only if that makes sense, add a nice screen-shot as below}_
